# Now it is time for our final project

* **We’ll create a simple application that plots out the popularity of tags associated with incoming tweets streamed live from Twitter.**

* To do all of this :

    - We first need to create a Twitter Developer Account to get our access codes.

    - Then you’ll need to install the tweepy library as well as matplotlib and seaborn.

    - Here is the link : apps.twitter.com
